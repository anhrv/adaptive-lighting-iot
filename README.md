# Adaptive lighting

Code for an IOT project. The idea is an adaptive lighting system, with the possibility of manual adjustment. The more ambient light there is, the less light is emitted and vice versa. The light level can also be manually set and it can be seen on the web app. The device was built using an ESP8266 microcontroller, a BH1750 sensor and an LED. Connectivity was made using a Firebase real-time database. The "front-end" app is a very simple HTML, CSS and JS app. This project was made for a university assignment (_Design and development of IOT projects_).
